KLANOMA PHP FRAMEWORK


This is the PHP framework I use for freelance development projects. It is 
an extension of the Simple PHP Framework (SPF) developed by Tyler Hall and available 
at https://github.com/tylerhall/simple-php-framework. Most class files are 
from the SPF, and I contributed the routing code (using .htaccess rewrite rules),
pages database table, and templating scheme.

Getting Started:
  *  Create a database from db_dump.sql
  *  Put DB setting in includes/class.config.php
  *  Verify that .htaccess paths are correct for rewrite
  *  You're in!


TODO's
  *  Templatize the user login and authorization
  *  Use caching so pages table isn't queried on every http request
  *  Allow sub pages in routing
  *  Thoroughly document in phpDocumentor syntax
  
Have fun,
